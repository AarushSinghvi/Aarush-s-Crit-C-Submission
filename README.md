# Aarush-s-Crit-C-Submission
This is the submission of my FINAL python code for Criterion C
This features a Python hangman game which I tried my best to make user-oriented and engaging through the use of the Tkinter library alongside adding functions for logging in and registering which gives it a personal touch and allows the code to save scores and also exit the program once they are done. This is to help practice Spanish which was my chosen problem in Crit A and this is definitely a huge step in my coding but alongside further updates and modifications this code can be improved.
